# 🔐 Secure User Authentication System 

## 📖 Overview

This project is a **Secure User Authentication System** developed in a **Jupyter Notebook** using **Python** and **Microsoft SQL Server**. It provides basic user authentication functionality, allowing users to **sign up** and **log in** securely. All credentials are stored in an SQL Server database, with passwords hashed to enhance security.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how Python can be used to interact with an MSSQL database for real-world authentication workflows, all from within an interactive and beginner-friendly Jupyter Notebook environment.
